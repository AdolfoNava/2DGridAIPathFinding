# 2DGridAIPathFinding
This is a Unity Work in progress repo about learning A* pathfinding for the first time and exploring how it functions and implications on a grid system

This is intended to make an AI move around the map and collect all the coins in the map with as little movement as possible without going in a diagonal

The build is in Unity 2019.4.10f1
